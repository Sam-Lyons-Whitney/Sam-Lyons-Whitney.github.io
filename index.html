<h3>Project 1: Video Game In Construct 3</h3>  

<p>In this project we made a video game using construct 3.
Our main objective was to create a video game using construct 3 which was a playable and enjoyable product. 
We also wanted to learn more about game design and how such things are conducted.
We achieved a basic platforming game using original sprites and code which looked like this:
(Pictures here)
The game consists of one main mechanic which is jumping between platforms and trying not to fall into the abyss. 
Our planning process was as follows:
	Create Sprites for the game
	Import those sprites 
	Begin coding the game
Before this we researched and practised with our chosen engine with a few tutorials and then began creating out sprites. 
We first split the work with one person creating the character sprites and the other making the background art and platform sprites. 
After spending some time making the sprites we imported them into our game file and began by using a template.
But we ended up having to code from scratch after a few technical bugs.
A problem we encountered near the end of production was that the template caused our code to stop working and we had to start again. 
Another problem on our end was time management and the fact that we spent so much time creating sprites and art
that we almost completely neglected the actual game part of our game. 
In future we will be less focused on making a game look nice and more on making it play well.
Construct 3 was fairly similar to its predecessor aside from an updated U.I and the fact that it didn’t require a download
and all your projects could be saved onto a google drive and easily shared. 
This fact was great for us as we had previous experience in Construct 2 which helped with general workflow and productivity.
If we do make another game using this engine we will take the things we learnt here and apply them to the next game 
which may include things like extra functionality and more levels and challenges. The end. </p>
